We Are Building a Simple Machine Learning model Using
**This is Begiiner friendly  Machine Learning Project**
-Trained ML model using Scikit-learn
-Used a Rest Api (Fast API)
-Used ML flow to see the model performance 
-Docker Container
-Local deployment

##Tech Stack 
Python 3.10
Docker Desktop
Vs code
Fast Api


"""import joblib
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train,y_train)
joblib.dump(model,'model.pkl)"""
run this code  in a python script 
This will create a PKL file  in your folder
we can train any model  that we are intrested  
If we don't have a data set we can use iris cifer-10 or titanic data set
