Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data.
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns.
Natural language processing helps computers understand and generate human language.
Computer vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world.
Reinforcement learning trains agents to make decisions through trial and error.
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for classification and regression tasks.
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without explicit labels or guidance.
Transfer learning allows models trained on one task to be adapted for related tasks.
Python is a popular programming language for data science and machine learning applications.
TensorFlow and PyTorch are leading frameworks for building deep learning models.
The Transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing in 2017.
GPT models use transformers to generate human-like text based on input prompts.
BERT introduced bidirectional training of transformers for better language understanding.
Convolutional neural networks excel at processing grid-like data such as images.
Recurrent neural networks are designed to handle sequential data like time series.
Attention mechanisms help models focus on relevant parts of the input data.
Embeddings convert categorical data into dense vector representations.
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to train neural networks.
Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well and fails on new data.
Cross-validation helps assess model performance and prevent overfitting.
